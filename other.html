        <h2> <B>What is Nanotechnology?</B></h2>
        <p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is 
          about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of 
          extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, 
          biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.</p>
          <p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and 
            molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the 
            buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies</p>
            The properties of materials can be different at the nanoscale for two main reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, nanomaterials have a relatively larger surface area when compared to the same mass 
of material produced in a larger form. This can make materials more chemically reactive 
(in some cases materials that are inert in their larger form are reactive when produced in 
their nanoscale form), and affect their strength or electrical properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second, quantum effects can begin to dominate the behavior of matter at the nanoscale
particularly at the lower end – affecting the optical, electrical and magnetic behavior of 
materials. Materials can be produced that are nanoscale in one dimension (for example, 
nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes), in two dimensions (plate-like shapes like 
nanocoating, nanolayers, and graphene) or in all three dimensions (for example, 
nanoparticles) 
            </li>
          </ul> 
          <p><b>Application of Nanotechnology</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             <b>Medicine:</b>  customized nanoparticles the size of molecules that can deliver drugs directly to 
              diseased cells in your body. When it's perfected, this method should greatly reduce the 
              damage treatment such as chemotherapy does to a patient's healthy cell
            </li>
            <li><b>Electronics</b>: it has some answers for how we might increase the capabilities of electronics 
              devices while we reduce their weight and power consumption.
              </li>
              <li>
               <b>Food</b> : it has an impact on several aspects of food science, from how food is grown to how 
it is packaged. Companies are developing nanomaterials that will make a difference not 
only in the taste of food but also in food safety and the health benefits that food delivery.
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Agriculture</b>  : nanotechnology can possibly change the whole agriculture part and 
nourishment industry anchor from generation to preservation, handling, bundling, 
transportation, and even waste treatment. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Vehicle manufacturers</b>: Much like aviation, lighter and stronger materials will be 
valuable for making vehicles that are both quicker and more secure. Burning motors will 
likewise profit from parts that are all the more hardwearing and higher temperature safe.

              </li>
          </ul>

Two particular types of nanoparticles commonly added to sunscreen are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. These tiny particles are not only highly effective at blocking UV radiation, they also feel lighter on the skin, which is why modern sunscreens are nowhere near as thick and gloopy as the sunscreens we were slathered in as kids.

            <p class="card-text">CLOTHING <BR> When used in textiles, nanoparticles of silica can help to create fabrics that repel water and other liquids. Silica can be added to fabrics either by being incorporated into the fabric’s weave or sprayed onto the surface of the fabric to create a waterproof or stainproof coating. So if you’ve ever noticed how liquid forms little beads on waterproof clothing – beads that simply roll off the fabric rather than being absorbed – that’s thanks to nanotechnology.</p>

      <p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and 
        molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the 
        buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies.<br>
        But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible 
        to see with the microscopes typically used in high school science classes. The microscopes needed 
        to see things at the nanoscale were invented relatively recently about 30 years ago.<br>
        As small as a nanometer is, it's still large compared to the atomic scale. An atom has a diameter of 
        about 0.1 nm. An atom's nucleus is much smaller about 0.00001 nm. Atoms are the building blocks 
        110<br>
        for all matter in our universe. You and everything around you are made of atoms. Nature has 
        perfected the science of manufacturing matter molecularly. For instance, our bodies are assembled 
        in a specific manner from millions of living cells. Cells are nature's nanomachines. At the atomic 
        scale, elements are at their most basic level. On the nanoscale, we can potentially put these atoms 
        together to make almost anything.<br>
        In a lecture called "Small Wonders: The World of Nanoscience," Nobel Prize winner Dr. Horst 
        Störmer said that the nanoscale is more interesting than the atomic scale because the nanoscale is 
        the first point where we can assemble something -- it's not until we start putting atoms together 
        that we can make anything useful.<br>
        People are interested in the nanoscale – because it is at this scale that the properties of materials 
        can be very different from those at a larger scale. We define nanoscience as the study of phenomena 
        and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and macromolecular scales, where properties 
        differ significantly from those at a larger scale; and nanotechnologies as the design, 
        characterization, production, and application of structures, devices, and systems by controlling 
        shape and size at the nanometer scale.</p>
