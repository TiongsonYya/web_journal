                        According to the Internet Architecture Board’s (IAB) definition, IoT is the networking of 
                smart objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the 
                presence of internet protocol that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as 
                components in buildings, vehicles or the environment
                    </li>
                    <li>According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) organization’s definition, IoT is 
                        the networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as 
                        limited bandwidth, power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability 
                        among smart objects</li>
                        <li>
                            According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s definition, IoT is a 
framework of all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a 
way that new applications and services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual 
world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication in the cloud.

                        <li>
                            According to the Oxford dictionary’s definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s 
computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful 
data

                            significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely 
                            transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.

                          <li><b><em>Technology Optimization </em></b>− The same technologies and data which improve the customer 
                            experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. 
                            IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.</li>
                              <li><b><em>Reduced Waste</em></b> − IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us 
                              superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective 
                              management of resources</li>
                                <li><b><em>Digital Assistant</em></b>: AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI

<p><b>Architecture of IoT</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Sensing Layer</b> - The main purpose of 
    the sensing layer is to identify any 
    phenomena in the devices’ peripheral 
    and obtain data from the real world. 
    This layer consists of several sensors. 
    Using multiple sensors for applications 
    is one of the primary features of IoT 
    devices. Sensors in IoT devices are 
    usually integrated through sensor hubs. 
    A sensor hub is a common connection 
    point for multiple sensors that 
    accumulate and forward sensor data to 
    the processing unit of a device. 
    Actuators can also intervene to change 
    the physical conditions that generate 
    the data. An actuator might, for 
    example, shut off a power supply, adjust an airflow valve, or move a robotic gripper in an 
    assembly process. Sensors in IoT devices can be classified into three broad categories as 
    described below:</li>
    <p><b>Motion Sensors</b>: Motion sensors measure the change in motion as well as the orientation 
      of the devices. There are two types of motions one can observe in a device: linear and 
      angular motions. The linear motion refers to the linear displacement of an IoT device 
      while the angular motion refers to the rotational displacement of the device. </p>
      <p><b>Environmental Sensors</b>: Sensors such as Light sensors, Pressure sensors, etc. are 
        embedded in IoT devices to sense the change in environmental parameters in the 
        device’s peripheral. The primary purpose of using environmental sensors in IoT devices 
        is to help the devices to take autonomous decisions according to the changes of a 
        device’s peripheral. For instance, environment sensors are used in many applications to 
        improve user experience (e.g., home automation systems, smart locks, smart lights, etc.).</p>
        <p><b>Position sensors</b>: Position sensors of IoT devices deal with the physical position and 
          location of the device. The most common position sensors used in IoT devices are 
          magnetic sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Magnetic sensors are 
          usually used as digital compass and help to fix the orientation of the device display. On 
          the other hand, GPS is used for navigation purposes in IoT devices.</p>
          <li><b>Network Layer </b>- The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected 
            in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is 
            implemented by using diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network, etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same 
            network.</li>
            <li><b>Data Processing Layer</b> - The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit 
              of IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses 
              the data to make decisions based on the result. In some IoT devices (e.g., smartwatch, smart 
              home hub, etc.), the data processing layer also saves the result of the previous analysis to 
              improve the user experience. This layer may share the result of data processing with other 
              connected devices via the network layer.</li>
              <li><b>Application Layer </b>- The application layer implements and presents the results of the data 
                processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a 
                user-centric layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications, 
                which include smart transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc.
                </li>
