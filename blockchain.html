        <h2> <B>What is Blockchain Technology?</B></h2>
        <p>Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked 
            using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, 
            and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).</p>
            <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that 
                is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data 
                (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>
               <p> <b>“Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have 
                three parts:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your 
most recent purchase from Amazon. (NOTE: This Amazon example is for illustrative 
purchases; Amazon retail does not work on a blockchain principle)

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your 
splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with Amazon.com, Inc. 
Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying 
information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I 
have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a 
“hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say you made your 
splurge purchase on Amazon, but while it’s in transit, you decide you just can’t resist and 
need a second one. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly 
identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique 
codes
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><b> In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, 
                    however, four things must happen:</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A transaction must occur. Let’s continue with the example of your impulsive Amazon 
                            purchase discussed in the introduction part of blockchain technology. After hastily clicking 
                            through multiple checkout prompt, you go against your better judgment and make a 
                            purchase</li>
                            <li>That transaction must be verified. After making that purchase, your transaction must be 
                                verified. With other public records of information, like the Securities Exchange 
                                Commission, Wikipedia, or your local library, there’s someone in charge of vetting new 
                                data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. These 
                                networks often consist of thousands (or in the case of Bitcoin, about five million ) 
                                computers spread across the globe.</li>
                                <li>
                                    That transaction must be stored in a block. After your transaction has been verified as 
accurate, it gets the green light. The transaction’s dollar amount, your digital signature, and 
Amazon’s digital signature are all stored in a block. There, the transaction will likely join 
hundreds, or thousands, of others like it.
                                </li>
                                <li>That block must be given a hash. Not unlike an angel earning its wings, once all of a block’s 
                                    transactions have been verified, it must be given a unique, identifying code called a hash. 
                                    The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. Once 
                                    hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A blockchain carries no transaction cost. (An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) The 
                        blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated 
                        and safe manner. One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block. This block is 
                        verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers distributed around the net. The verified block 
                        is added to a chain, which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record, but a unique 
                        record with a unique history. Falsifying a single record would mean falsifying the entire chain in 
                        millions of instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for monetary 
                        transactions, but it can be deployed in many other ways</p>
                        <p><b>The three main properties of Blockchain Technology are:</b></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Decentralization</b></li>
                            <p>In a decentralized system , the information is not stored by one single entity. 
                                In fact, everyone in the network owns the information.
                                </p>
                                <li><b>Transparency</b></li>
                            <p>A person’s identity is hidden via complex cryptography and represented only by their 
                                public address. So, if you were to look up a person’s transaction history, you will not see 
                                “Bob sent 1 BTC” instead you will see “1MF1bhsFLkBzzz9vpFYEmvwT2TbyCt7NZJ 
                                sent 1 BTC.
                                </p>
                                <li><b>Immutability</b></li>
                                <p>Immutability, in the context of the blockchain, means that once something has been entered 
                                    into the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with.
                                    </p>
                                    
                        </ol>
                        <p><b>Application of blockchain
                        </b></p>
                        <p>Crowdfunding</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Crowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are doing the advance work for 
                                the emerging peer-to-peer economy. The popularity of these sites suggests people want to 
                                have a direct say in product development. Blockchains take this interest to the next level, 
                                potentially creating crowd-sourced venture capital fund</li>
                                <li>In 2016, one such experiment, the Ethereum-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous 
                                    Organization), raised an astonishing $200 million USD in just over two months. 
                                    Participants purchased “DAO tokens” allowing them to vote on smart contract venture
                                    capital investments (voting power was proportionate to the number of DAO they were 
                                    holding).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Governance</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>By making the results fully transparent and publicly accessible, distributed database 
                                technology could bring full transparency to elections or any other kind of poll taking. 
                                Ethereum-based smart contracts help to automate the process</li>
                                <li>The app, Boardroom, enables organizational decision-making to happen on the blockchain. 
                                    In practice, this means company governance becomes fully transparent and verifiable when 
                                    managing digital assets, equity or information.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Decentralizing file storage on the internet brings clear benefits. Distributing data 
                                throughout the network protects files from getting hacked or lost.</li>
                                <li>Interplanetary File System (IPFS) makes it easy to conceptualize how a distributed web 
                                    might operate. Similar to the way a BitTorrent moves data around the internet, IPFS gets 
                                    rid of the need for centralized client-server relationships (i.e., the current web).</li>
