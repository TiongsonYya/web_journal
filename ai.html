                        <ol>
                          <li>High Accuracy with fewer errors: AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors 
                            and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information</li>
                            <li>High-Speed: AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, because 
                              of that AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.</li>
                              <li>High reliability: AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action 
                                multiple times with high accuracy.</li>
                                <li>Useful for risky areas: AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a 
                                  bomb, exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be risky.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>Digital Assistant: AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI 
                                    technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show the products as 
                                    per customer requirements.</li>
                                    <li>Useful as a public utility: AI can be very useful for public utilities such as a selfdriving car which can make our journey safer and hassle-free, facial recognition for 
                                      security purposes, Natural language processing (for search engines, for spelling 
                                      checker, for assistant like Siri, for translation like google translate), etc.</li>

                        <ol>
                          <li>High Cost: The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots 
                            of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</li>
                            <li>Can't think out of the box: Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they 
                              cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, 
                              or programmed.</li>
                                <li> No feelings and emotions: AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does 
                                  not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with humans, and 
                                  may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken
                                  </li>
                                  <li>Increase dependence on machines: With the increment of technology, people are getting 
                                    more dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.</li>
                                    <li>No Original Creativity: As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but 
                                      still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and 
                                      imaginative.</li>

              <p class="mb-0"><ul>
                <li>The year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren 
                  McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.</li>
                  <li>The year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the 
                    connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.</li>
                    <li>The year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered 
                      Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and 
                      Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to 
                      exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.</li>

                intelligence program" Which was named "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 
                38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some 
                theorems.</li>
                <li>The year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer 
                  scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as 
                  an academic field. At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, 
                  LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.</li>

<h3><B>Levels of AI</B></h3>
<P>Stage 1 – Rule-Based Systems<BR>
  The most common uses of AI today fit in this bracket, covering everything from business software 
  (Robotic Process Automation) and domestic appliances to aircraft autopilots.
  </P>
<p>Stage 3 – Context Awareness and Retention<br>
  ➢ Algorithms that develop information about the specific domain they are being applied 
  in. They are trained on the knowledge and experience of the best humans, and their 
  knowledge base can be updated as new situations and queries arise. Well, known 
  applications of this level are chatbots and “roboadvisors”.
  </p>
  <p>Stage 3 – Domain-Specific Expertise<br>
    ➢ Going beyond the capability of humans, these systems build up expertise in a specific 
    context taking in massive volumes of information which they can use for decision 
    making. Successful use cases have been seen in cancer diagnosis and the well-known 
    Google Deepmind’s AlphaGo. Currently, this type is limited to one domain only would 
    forget all it knows about that domain if you started to teach it something else. </p>
    <p>Stage 4 – Reasoning Machines<br>
      ➢ These algorithms have some ability to attribute mental states to themselves and others 
      – they have a sense of beliefs, intentions, knowledge, and how their own logic works. 
      This means they could reason or negotiate with humans and other machines. At the 
      moment these algorithms are still in development, however, commercial applications 
      are expected within the next few years.</p>
      <p>Stage 5 – Self Aware Systems / Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)<br>
        ➢ These systems have human-like intelligence – the most commonly portrayed AI in 
        media – however, no such use is in evidence today. It is the goal of many working in 
        AI and some believe it could be realized already from 2024</p>
        <p>Stage 6 – Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)<br>
          ➢ AI algorithms can outsmart even the most intelligent humans in every domain. 
          Logically it is difficult for humans to articulate what the capabilities might be, yet we 
          would hope examples would include solving problems we have failed to so far, such as 
          world hunger and dangerous environmental change. </p>
          <p>Stage 7 – Singularity and Transcendence<br>
            ➢ This is the idea that development provided by ASI (Stage 6) leads to a massive 
            expansion in human capability. Human augmentation could connect our brains to each 
            other and to a future successor of the current internet, creating a “hive mind” that shares 
            ideas, solves problems collectively, and even gives others access to our dreams as 
            observers or participants.</p>

            <h3><b>Types of AI</b></h3>

            <p><b>A. Based on Capabilities</b></p>
            <p>Weak AI or Narrow AI:<br>
              ➢ Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with 
              intelligence. The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the 
              world of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
              <p>2. General AI:<br>
                ➢ General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with 
                efficiency like a human.<br>
                ➢ The idea behind the general AI to make such a system that could be smarter and 
                think like a human on its own.</p>
                <p>3. Super AI:<br>
                  ➢ Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass 
                  human intelligence, and can perform any task better than a human with cognitive 
                  properties. This refers to aspects like general wisdom, problem solving and 
                  creativity. It is an outcome of general AI.<br>
                  ➢ Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, 
                  to reason solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate on its 
                  own.<br>
                  ➢ Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. The development 
                  of such systems in real is still a world-changing task.</p>
                  <p><b>B. Based on functionality</b></p>
                  <p>1. Reactive Machines<br>
                  
                    ➢ Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
                    ➢ Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.<br>
                    ➢ These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best 
                    action.</p>
                    <p>2. Limited Memory<br>
                      ➢ Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short 
                      period of time.<br>
                      ➢ These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.<br>
                      ➢ Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These 
                      cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed 
                      limits, and other information to navigate the road.</p>
                      <p>3. Theory of Mind<br>
                        ➢ Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able 
                        to interact socially like humans.<br>
                        ➢ This type of AI machines is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of 
                        efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.</p>
                        <p>4. Self-Awareness<br>
                          ➢ Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be 
                          super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and selfawareness.<br>
                          ➢ These machines will be smarter than the human mind.<br>
                          ➢ Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.</p>
