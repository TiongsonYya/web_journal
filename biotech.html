        <h2> <B>What is Biotechnology?</B></h2>
        <p>It is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, 
            or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives 
            thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use"</p>
         <p>One example of modern biotechnology is genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is the process 
            of transferring individual genes between organisms or modifying the genes in an organism to 
            remove or add a desired trait or characteristic.
            Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular 
            biology, etc.). New technologies and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g.
            Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture (development of genetically 
            modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of 
            chemicals, paper, textiles, and food).</p>
        
         
          <p><b>Application of Biotechnology</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <b>  Agriculture (Green Biotechnology):</b> Biotechnology had contributed a lot to modify the 
                genes of the organism known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops, 
                Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the 
                manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done 
                to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc.
            </li>
            <li><b>Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology):</b> This helps in the formation of genetically modified 
                insulin known as humulin. This helps in the treatment of a large number of diabetes 
                patients. It has also given rise to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene therapy is a 
                technique to remove the genetic defect in an embryo or child. This technique involves the 
                transfer of a normal gene that works over the non-functional gene
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Aquaculture Fisheries:</b> It helps in improving the quality and quantity of fishes. Through 
                biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed via gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Environment (Environmental biotechnology):</b> is used in waste treatment and pollution 
                prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than 
                conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based 
                disposal. Every organism ingests nutrients to live and produces by-products as a result. 
                Different organisms need different types of nutrients
              </li>
